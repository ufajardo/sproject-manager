## Additional Notes:

The purpose for this project is for training purposes. Allows me to learn/exercise how to create API endpoints and manipulate the data, further my understanding of models, and how to create a CRUD system with said models. There are many improvements that can be made but will unlikely be pursued at this time. Interesting additions could be:

1. Adding collaborators to the projects and the ability to assign tasks/projects to other people.
2. Log Task/Project data/statistics such as how many tasks are pending, average time tickets are opened, etc
3. Plot graphs based on information.
